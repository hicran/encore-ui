<h3>Static Progressbars</h3>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    There are two states for progress bars:
    <ul>
      <li>Active progress bars have animated stripes.</li>
      <li>Full progress bars are solid and static in appearance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Several options for displaying text with a progress bar are
    available:
    <ul>
      <li>No Text</li>
      <li>Percentage (not italicized)</li>
      <li>Detailed Text (italicized)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Always try to show a percentage. Your focus should be to enter specific
    text, since it reveals both numeric progress and provides context for
    what progress is being tracked.
    See demo below.
  </li>
</ul>
